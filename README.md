# Distributed File System Client

This project focuses on implementing a client for a read-only distributed file system using Python. The system relies on the File Service Protocol (FSP) and the Name Service Protocol (NSP) for accessing files.

## Task

Implement the `GET` command for the FSP protocol.

## Usage

```bash
python3 fileget.py -f <SURL> -n <NAMESERVER>
